For task 1, briefly describe how the code coverage tool can help in developing test cases and the weaknesses of simply using code coverage as a testing metric.

The code coverage tool was very helpful to make me determine which test cases are not covered 100% from the code coverage view. In my test cases, addItem and removeItem methods were not fully covered in VendingMachine.java. I fixed those two test methods by at the coverage value. Then only I could make it 100% coverage for VendingMachine.java file.

I think simply using code coverage will not be good idea as testing metric. It can not eliminate mutants properly, I think so. So we need muclipse for that purpose. So this might be a weakness for code coverage.
